====================
|theme_display| Demo
====================

This demo documentation showcases how the content is stylized by |theme_display| (from the package |theme_pypi_link|).

If this is the first theme you're looking at, you'll want to look at the pages within the :doc:`kitchen-sink/index` section. Those pages contain nearly all the elements that Sphinx supports out-of-the-box, and should give you a good idea of how stuff looks in this theme.
